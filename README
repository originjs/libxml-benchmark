Overview
--------
    This package provides basic benchmarks for main C/C++ multiplatform 
    parsers. Some of Java parsers also included for comparision.
    
    This version supports following benchmarks:
	Parsing: SAX & DOM
	Validating: XML Schema
	DOM: Creating DOM tree, Serialization
	Security: XML Signature, XML Encryption
	XSL Transformation
    
    Following XML sources supported:
	Any well-formed XML file ( XML, XSL, XSD )
	Automatic generation of random simple XML file
	Automatic generation of random XML OPC-DA message sequence

    Following parsers supported:
	libxml2 + libgdome + libxslt + xmlsec
	xerces + xalan
	expat + sablotron + cslxml + arabica
	RXP parser
	Oracle XDK for C, C++, Java
	IBM xml4c + Lotus XML (not supported)
	Sun XML Pack + Apache XML Security

Build
-----
    1. Install all required libraries
    2. Check options You want in Makefile.in
    3. Rip off all benchmarks coresponded to unavailable libraries from Makefile.in
    4. Update library paths in Makefile.in
    5. Select compilers in Makefile.in
    6. make

Oracle Notes
------------
    To have part (not all, but maximum possible) user readable error messages
    following enviroment virables must be set
    
	ORA_NLS33=/usr/share/xdk/nlsdata
	ORA_XML_MESG=/usr/share/xdk/mesg

    Oracle XDK 9.0 have rather old XML Schema implementation and don't understand 
    OPC Schema, other schemas also can be incompatible with it.
    
    Oracle XDK 9.2.0.6.0 have up-to-date XML Schema implementation but buggy. Can 
    drop core on some non-valid documents. ( May be for some of valids also )

Sablotron Notes
---------------
    All versions, I tested (0.96, 0.96.1, 0.97) failed to process long large
    <opcgen> generated documents. Fixed in 0.98.

Gnime XML Library
-----------------
    Gnome XML 2.6.5 library have problems with validation of xsd:QName attributes

Gnome XML Security (prior to 1.2.0)
------------------
    Gnome XML security library prior to 1.2.0 lacks support for reading public keys from X509 
    certificates. Because of that if you want to use xmlsec 1.1.x or earlier, you must 
    rebuild xmlsec with coresponded patch available in 'patches/' directory. 
    Versions 1.2.x don't need to be patched.

Apache XML Security for C (from CVS tree)
-------------------------
    Apache XML Security for C (CVS 07.02.2004) have problems in transcoding code, resulting in
    random segmenation faults. Please find temorary fix in 'patches/' directory.
